<!--
This file holds details of all the upgrades for JIRA

There is no longer a concept of editions since JIRA 4.x and hence all upgrade tasks
should be placed in this file.

The makeup of this XML file is described here :

<upgrades> The root node of the file. Everything should be contained within this node
    <upgrade> Each upgrade element describes an upgrade task.
        Attributes
        1. build -  This defines the build that the upgrade applies to

        <class> The class element defines the name of the class which performs the upgrade
-->
