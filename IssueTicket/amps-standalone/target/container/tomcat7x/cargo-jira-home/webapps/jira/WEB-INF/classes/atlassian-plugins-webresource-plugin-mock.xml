    <!--
    This file is just a mock to enable Soy usage in setup - without it Soy templates cannot be rendered, as there is no
    com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-plugins-webresource-plugin:context-path web resource, so this needs to be mocked.
    Previously there was an implementation of AuiIntegration interface, but it was removed as there is no auiplugin-spi
    since AUI 5.7.0; before that, contextPath() soy helper was provided by JiraAuiIntegration, now it is provided by
    com.atlassian.soy:atlassian-soy-core plugin (which is dependency of com.atlassian.soy.soy-template-plugin - JIRA's
    webresources depend on this one). Due to dependencies of atlassian-plugins-webresource-plugin, is cannot be
    enabled in setup.

    LEGO-666: This also provides the noop implementation of jsI18n resource transformer that is provided by
    com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-plugins-webresource-plugin and if not present results in many WARNING messages
    in log files during setup.
