#disable_html_escaping()
## this is very much a hack - and assumes a lot of things about how a custom field works.
## please ensure that this will work for you before you use this template.
## NOTE: This only has to put the urlPrefix in the href now since the url
## passed in has become much smarter and has already accounted for the custom
## fields value.
## NOTE: the purpose of this template is for custom fields which *could* take an HTML value, and thus should not
## be encoded. For fields which should always be encoded, use the label-searcher-basictext.vm template.
#if ($value)
#if ($urlPrefix && $urlPrefix != '')
    <a href="${urlPrefix}">$cfValueEncoder.encodeForHtml($value)</a>
#else
    $cfValueEncoder.encodeForHtml($value)
#end
#end
